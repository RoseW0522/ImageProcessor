Description of how to use the photo editor program by Ryan Chaput and Ruisi Wang.

How to use the GUI:

-Opening GUI will start with a blank image space and buttons to control the GUI

-Load button opens a file browser to select the image to be opened. Supports loading .JPG, .PNG, .BMP, and .PPM files

-Save button opens a file browser to save the currently displayed image. Supports saving .JPG, .PNG, .BMP, and .PPM files

-Exit button will exit the program without saving the current image.

-Greyscale button will apply a greyscale filter based on the luma component of each pixel

-Sepia button will apply a sepia filter to the current image

-Blur button will blur the image (specifics provided in the README file)

-Sharpen button will sharpen the image (specifics provided in the README file)

-The six component buttons (red, blue, green, luma, intensity, and value component buttons) will convert the image
to greyscale based on the selected component, providing a visualization of the selected component

-The three flip components will flip the current image in the listed ways: Horizontal, Vertical, or both

-The brighten button will brighten the current image by a value of +25 (adds 25 to the value of each pixel component)

-The darken button will darken the current image by a value of -25, similar to the brighten button

-The window can be resized and scroll bars are provided if the full image cannot be displayed in the current window size
    -If scroll bars are not present, resize the window slightly, and they will appear
